Infrastructure
--------------
 o gfile re-write
   - mkgfile needs full error checking
   - re-work images a bit, open from gfile not names
   - new index types etc...
 o sort out API mess
   - refine model type API for skeletal animation
   - tidy up keyboard / cmd_bind code
 o Re-think console and HUD
   - much can be done before rendering to texture
   - eg. line buffered approach, store array of pointers to last 1 page worth
     of lines
   - support shift keys, etc..
 o Screenshots
 o Mipmap support for textures
 o Shader infrastructure 

World
-----
 o multi-texture the lightmaps
 o we do check polys against view frustum in bsp render yeah?
 o physics model for collisions, gravity, smooth movement
 o Calculate PRT 

Models
------
 x Hook up animation code
 o Allow multiple models
 o Attach heads + weapons
 o Texture support
 o Calculate normals (in tangent space?)
 o Normal mapping

Lighting Model
--------------
 o Realistic water
 o Stencil shadows for models
 o Compute PRT wavelet coefficients for maps
 o need access to light-source data for normal maps both on
   world and on models. how to handle multiple lights?
   - could select dominant lights for each scene, at least for shadows
   - theres about 8 opengl light sources
   - possibly LOD system falling back to lightmaps/projections

BSP tools
---------
 o Import the code and get it compiling and tested
 o Replace rad with wavelet PRT info etc..
 o Normal-map support
 o Allow patches aswell as brushes
 o new output file format? keep portals?

Game
----
Hehehe, long way off yet
