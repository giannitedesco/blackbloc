Things to do
------------
Infrastructure:
 o sort out API mess
   - re-work images a bit
   - add a model type API
 o Re-think console and HUD
   - much can be done before rendering to texture
   - eg. line buffered approach, store array of pointers to last 1 page worth
     of lines
   - support shift keys, etc..
 o tidy up input layer
 o Screenshots
 o Mipmap support for textures
 o Shader support

World
-----
 o Collision model / gravity
 o Basic physics model for smooth movement
 o Translucent water + fresnel effect
 o Stencil shadows
 o Spherical Harmonic lighting

BSP tools
---------
 o Import the code and get it compiling and tested
 o Replace rad with spherical harmonics coefficients etc..

Models
------
 o half-life studio model support (UPDATE: prolly scrap this)
   x fix endian bugs
   - fix render bugs
   - use gfile framework
   - use model framework
   - use texture framework
 o Normal maps for details
 o New character models + kinematics

Frustum Culling
---------------
 Frustum is 6 planes: 4 sides, near and far
 The dot-product of a point and a plane is the distance.
 Radius is abs(the furthest extent)
 If distance + radius > 0 then point is inside the plane.
 If point is inside all 6 planes, job done
